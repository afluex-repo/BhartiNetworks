                                <p>One of the fastest changes in mobile network rollouts is occurring inside the buildings. Small cells are the ideal solution for providing coverage and capacity to indoor traffic hot spots and other priority areas, such as;- Airports, railways stations, Hotels, Shopping centers, and Large corporate clients.</p>
                                <p> It has been estimated that 70-90% of all mobile calls and data traffic are originated from the customers inside the buildings.  With the introduction of 5G in higher frequency bands(mm-wave), it would be difficult to meet indoor network service requirements through outdoor macro sites, the most preferable way to provide ubiquitous mobile connectivity is to deploy small cells inside the buildings standalone or integrated with the macro layer to create heterogeneous networks. That provides good coverage and capacity inside the building and at the same time off-load traffic from the outdoor cells. These solutions are mostly based on Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS), Fiber Optic Distribution Antenna Systems (FODAS), or Pico/microBTSs.</p>
